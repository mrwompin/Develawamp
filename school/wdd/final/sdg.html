						<h2>Response: 11 Predictions for the Future of Programming</h2>
						<h6>Matt Markwald</h6>
						<p>Overall I really enjoyed the article and it gave me a lot to think about. On most accounts I agree with the author, although I am very surprised that blockchain technology was not mentioned. With major banks looking into the technology and significant investment already in platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum I found it Surprising. The following are a few of my responses to specific predictions in the article.</p>
						<h4>Cloud computing will defeat Moore's Law.</h4>
						<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_lawF" title="Wikipedia: Moore's Law">Moore's law</a> is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles on average every two years. As a result procescing speed doubled every two years. There were recent concerns that this trend has started to slow down and therefore technogy and processing potential would hit a wall, but this article alledges that cloud computing will solve the dilehma by removing the burdon of processing power from the client, to the server which is far more capable of growing in processing power. This appears to be a reasonable claim  as the trend seems to move towards cloud-based-services and cloud-based-archetecture. </p>
						<h4>UI design will get more complicated as PCs continue to fade</h4>
						<p>For this claim the author cited the decreasing number of tasks users are choosing to complete with traditional PC. As advances in mobile design and computing allow users to move more of their tasks to mobile alternatives, the author sees a shift towards more advanced UI features with event-handling for form more complicated triggers such as touch. Since programmers won't be able to reliably assume that a user has a physical keyboard or mouse, UI design will have to advance and change approach in order to stay relevant. It should also be added that advances in   </p>
						<h4>The End of Openess</h4>
						<p>In this prediction the author laments the end of open software creation. The author bases this prediction on two factors, middleman in software distribution and the decline of PC purchases. The author believes that due to the decline in PC sales there will be less code created and compiled and therefore less code shared. To address the idea that there is less shared code due to middleman, platforms like GitHub allows people all over to the world to copy, compile, run, and contribute code to existing or new projects. For the author to claim that game consoles not allowing 3rd party development, or app stores enforcing quality control for their distribution platform is somehow ending freely available code seems a bit hyperbolic. The amount of plugins, extensions, stand alone apps, etc that are created collaboratively and distributed freely is staggering. On the author's second point, a decline in PC purchases does not signal to me the end of PC access. In a study of statistics gathered by the <a href="https://www.childtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/69_fig1.jpg" title="Child Trends DATABANK">Child Trends Databank from 1982 to 2014</a> access to a computer at home rose from 15.3% to a high of 84.9% before declining slightly to 78.5%. Even counting the decline in 6% from 2013-2014 that is still an overall increase of 63% from 1982. In fact, according to the U.S. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=24812" title="Energy Information Administration">Energy Information Administration 95% of educational buildings use computers, on average educational buildings have twice as many computers as commercial buildings, and that the vast majority of the equipment are desktop computers (more than 1,600 per million squarefeet) the next biggest amount being laptops</a>. While much of this equipment will be replaced with mobile alternatives as time goes on, whether or not students have access to computers powerful enough compile code will be more dependent on whether or not schools are investing in Computer Science related course options. If there are no classes geared towards teaching students software and programming basics, whether or not their equipment can handle compiling code is a moot point.</p>

						<h2>Response: Future Proof Your IT Career</h2>
						<h6>Caleb Wagner</h6>
						<h3>Critical Analysis</h3>
						<p>In the article Future Proof Your IT Career, the author makes predictions on 9 different areas that will be in high need in the year 2020. The first area it states will be still booming in 2020 is Cloud Computing. According to the article more than 90% of companies are currently using some form of cloud computing, furthermore it states that in 2014 a report found that companies were moving their infrastructure to private and public clouds. I agree that cloud computing will be a booming field in 3 years from now and even beyond. During some <a href="https://www.recode.net/2015/4/30/11562024/too-embarrassed-to-ask-what-is-the-cloud-and-how-does-it-work" title="Too Embarassed to Ask What is the Cloud">research of my own I discovered that cloud computing is a process of which developers create and deploy applications using the cloud</a>. The cloud is software and services that are provided by a big company server over the internet. The advantages of clouds and cloud computing are defined by the ability to develop and create software or save information, but the saved information doesnt take up your devices storage and your device may not necessarily have to be an expensive, or powerful machine to compute or store information. </p>
						<p>Another area the article mentions is going to be booming years to come is the cyber security fields. The article mentions this in many places, and I agree that it will be booming indefinitely. In the past with devices not being networked together security wasnt as much of an issue, since to access any sensitive digital information, a physical storage device with the information on it would be needed. But now and going into the future with the connectivity of devises through networking, there is a large potential for information to no longer be secure. In addition to information security, prevention from system hijacking and entering of malicious software is a big part of security. Both security risks I see as always being present therefore cyber security will always be needed. </p>
						<p>The article also mentions a career that seems to be more like a reference to a quality that IT Careerist will have in the future. They call them Digital Artisans. These people are to have these qualities, they are to be authentic, transformation-minded, intelligent, speedy, artistic and non-Conformist. I agree that most of these qualities are wanted in IT professionals now, with one exception non-conformist. I fell that there is still a large amount of companies that tend to conform to a general older path. You dont always have to be different to be the best big new thing. </p>
						<p>The article overall shares a common theme that is to secure your future career in IT, consider and be familiar with the internet and how much of IT is related to the internet. Weather its cloud computing, securing information and systems, API development, or many other areas, they all are heavily reliant on and related to the internet.   </p>

						<h2>Response: That Time Bill Gates and Steve Jobs Argued about the Future of Computers</h2>
						<h6>Devin Brough</h6>
						<p>The article explores the different views Bill Gates and Steve Jobs had for handling the Computer. </p>
						<p>For Bill the computer was a way of developing his software in a way that was not just methodical, but also direct, each step building on the business of the computer while growing with the business. Steve on the other hand wanted to build a computer for the people. By building up the idea  of the personal computer, Jobs was able to market computers direct to the individual.</p>
						<p>Today, Windows PC is the stronger contender in the computer market largly due to businesses utilyzing computers more often than the individual. However, with the invention of smart phones, Apple has begun to grow on the market. Both businesses have been extremely successful, but for different reasons and at different times each working with their specific vision of the computer. </p>
						<p>In the future I see Windows still leading PC and home desktops sales. Windows has not only capitalized on the function of the GUI that, is not only easy to navigate but personalizable, all in a package that is significantly cheaper than MAC. </p>

						<h4>Interview With the Team</h4>
						<p>Intro</p>
						<blockquote>
							<ol>
								<li>Are there conflicts or consensus between these sites?
									<blockquote>
										<ul>
											<li>Group A: All in All these sites tend to come to a general consensus that, Computers are going to grow and evolve just as they have. Its our duties as developers and the new generation to keep up with the changes and help the growth effort.</li>
											<li>Matt A: After reading I see that Cloud computing may beat out previous trends in processor speed vs. time. </li>
											<li>Devin A: I see the the future as a booming however, my article asserts that in terms of markets and big business, there may be little change since the leading industry is for the general consumer.</li>
											<li>Caleb A: As Digital Artisans, the IT workforce will continue to change and evolve, however my article asserts far more similarities to the past and present showing change and similarities. I believe that the IT industry will evolve while still maintaining its roots.</li>
										</ul>
									</blockquote></li>
									<li>Does the future of IT scare or excite you?
										<blockquote>
											<ul>
												<li>Matt A: Technology itself being neutral, I am concerned with the application of technology. If technology is not used to improve lives of average people then I do not see much point. I am excited by the idea of more people getting access to and knowledge of computer systems and programming.</li>
												<li>Devin A: A little bit both of both honestly. Looking at both how Steve views the computer as a personalized device and how Gates views the computer as something to progress the business scene, it is quite obvious that both of these types of technology have moved forward at incredibly quick rates. The future could lead to the point where computers are our businesses and they are our only way of expressing ourselves. Maybe that's what is truly meant by computers taking over the world and controlling humanity. We will be so swept up in the next big thing for computers that we won't pay attention to the present and things going on now.</li>
												<li>Caleb A: The Future of IT tends to scare me. With how fast things tend to develop and the rise of artificial intelligence, coupled with the fantastic intellisense's that are being put out, could put me as a developer out of a job.</li>
											</ul>
